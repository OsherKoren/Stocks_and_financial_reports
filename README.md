# Stocks_and_financial_reports
Data processing of stocks and financial reports
This project takes data from financial statement summaries of more than 1000 public companies. More historical and up to date. Then, I have collected data on the share price at the appropriate time for the financial statements.
I merged the data and analyzed it with financial ratios and visualization.
